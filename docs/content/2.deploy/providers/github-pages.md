# GitHub Pages

Deploy Nitro apps to GitHub Pages.

**Preset:** `github-pages` ([switch to this preset](/deploy/#changing-the-deployment-preset))

Nitro supports deploying on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with minimal configuration.

## Setup

Follow the steps to [create a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

## Deployment

Here is an example GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your site to GitHub Pages using the `github-pages` preset:

```yaml
# https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages#usage
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: corepack enable
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"

      # Pick your own package manager and build script
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
        env:
          NITRO_PRESET: github-pages

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: ./.output/public

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    # Add a dependency to the build job
    needs: build

    # Grant GITHUB_TOKEN the permissions required to make a Pages deployment
    permissions:
      pages: write      # to deploy to Pages
      id-token: write   # to verify the deployment originates from an appropriate source

    # Deploy to the github-pages environment
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    # Specify runner + deployment step
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1
```
